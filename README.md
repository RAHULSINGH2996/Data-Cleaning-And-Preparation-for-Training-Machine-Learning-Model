# PROJECT: Data-Cleaning-And-Preparation-for-Training-Machine-Learning-Model

In this project we will perform data cleaning on the Titanic Dataset in order to prepare our data, to be used as a training set for a logistic regression Machine Learning model. The final aim of the model would be to predict a classification: Survived or Deceased, but the extent of this project is just uptill the Data cleaning and Preapraton steps.
We would also be looking at some visualizations of the data in order to get an insight of the classification.

The tools used in this project are :

1. Python Pandas
2. Python Numpy
3. Python Matplotlib
4. Python Seaborn

The major steps involved in Data cleaning and preparation are:

1. Handling missimg values
2. Handling null values
3. Handling duplicate values
4. Adding/Dropping/Renaming Columns
5. Dropping rows based on conditions
6. Changing Column formats
7. Converting Categorical features to numbers, etc.


Once all of these steps have been undertaken our data will be consisting of all numbers and would be ready to go into our MAchine Learning model.
