# PROJECT: Data-Cleaning-And-Preparation-for-Training-Machine-Learning-Model

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Your team is building a Machine Learning model which will predict whether a passenger survived or not in the Titanic crash. As a Junior Data Scientist you are tasked with cleaning and preparation of the data, for it to be used as a training set for the logistic regression Machine Learning model. The final aim of the model would be to predict a classification: Survived or Deceased. 

But here in this project, we are just concerned with the Data cleaning and Preapraton steps.

We would also be looking at some visualizations of the data in order to get an insight of the data.

we are provided with a CSV file containing the details of all the passengers onboard the Titanic at the time of the crash.

The tools used in this project are :

1. Python Pandas
2. Python Numpy 
3. Python Matplotlib
4. Python Seaborn

The major steps involved in Data cleaning and preparation are:

1. Handling missimg values
2. Handling null values
3. Handling duplicate values
4. Removing Errors and Inaccuracies
5. Remove Outliers and Create Complete Information
6. Adding/Dropping/Renaming Columns
7. Dropping rows based on conditions
8. Changing Column formats
9. Converting Categorical features to numbers, etc.


Once all of these steps have been undertaken our data will be consisting of all numbers and would be ready to go into our MAchine Learning model.
